# ScienceForFun

A collection of interactive scientific simulations and visualizations.

## ðŸš€ About
This project explores how complex natural phenomena can emerge from simple mathematical models. By translating equations into code, we can visualize behaviors that are not immediately obvious from the formulas alone.

Current implementations include:
- Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion model

## âœ¨ Features
- Interactive Jupyter Notebook demonstrations
- Visualizations that reveal hidden patterns
- Beginner-friendly scientific computing examples
